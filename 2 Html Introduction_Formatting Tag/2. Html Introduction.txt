HTML
----
1. Full form of HTML is Hypertext Markup language.
where Hypertext means a text which contains link to another text, and markup language means tag(<>) based language.
Markup language works on three terminology :
    a. Definition
    b. Processing
    c. Presentation

2. Html document consists of multimmedia content(audio, video, animation,images etc)

3. We can create HTML document on any word processing tool.
Word processing tool = wordpad, notepad etc
editor = vs code, sublime text etc
tool = dreamviewer
IDE(Integrated Development Enviroment) = netbeans , eclipse etc

4. We need to save html document by .html or .htm extension and output is going to be displayed out on browser screen.
5. Currently Html5 is going in the market.
6. HTML5 provides you audio video tag 
   HTML5 provides you semantic tags(<header>,<footer>,<article> etc)
   HTML5 simplifies Doctype declaration
   HTML5 provides various input types
   HTML5 deals with javaScript to make html as a dhtml(dynamic html)

7. Html also works on three terminology : 
    a. tag
    b. attribute
    c. element

    a. Tag : Tags are hidden keywords, which are mainly used to display content on output screen.Tags can be classifies as : 
        
        i. Empty Tag (unbalanced tag)
            Only opening and no closing
            Ex : <br>,<hr>,<img>,<input> etc

        ii. Container Tag (balanced tag)
            Opening and closing both
            Ex : <html></html>, <head></head>, <div></div> etc

        iii. Self closing tag (</>)
            Ex : <br/>,<hr/>,<img/>,<input/> etc

        iv. Semantic Tag
            Tag which shows there meaning by name
            <header> = tells the content it consists is for header section
            <footer> = tells the content it consists is for footer section    
            <section> = tells the content it consists is for specific section  etc 

        v. Non-Semantic Tag (Structural tag)
            Generalized Tag which means this tags can be included in any semantic tag. Like <div> can be added in <header> also and <footer> also, likewise we can create form by <form> tag can be added in <header> also and in <footer> also.
            Ex: <div>, <form>, <table> etc 

    b. Attribute : Attribute provides some additional information.
        <img src='' height='' width=''>
        <p align=''>

        Here src, height, width, align etc are all attributes which provides some additional information.

    c. Element : Html is an element, which represents whole document and it comprises of opening of html tag <html> and closing of html tag</html>.

    Body is an element, which represents document's body and it comprises of opening of body tag <body> and closing of body tag</body>.
