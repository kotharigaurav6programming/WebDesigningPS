Introduction of JavaScript
--------------------------
1. Javascript was developed by Brenden Eich in 1995.
2. JavaScript was mainly came to overcome the limitations of VBScript.

Limitations of VBScript : 
i. Browser Specific -- Internet Explorer
ii. Operating System specific -- Window OS

3. JavaScript was initially known as LiveScript, but java programming language was very popular at that time, so Brenden Eich simply for gaining popularity puts its script name as JavaScript. 

Note : JavaScript and Java are two different things, JavaScript is a scripting language whereas java is a programming language.

4. JavaScript is a client side as well as server side scripting language.

client side --- Front End Part----> Html, CSS, Bootstrap , React JS etc
|-- Mainly used for the purpose of validation and events.

server side --- Back End Part-----> Node , Express etc
|-- Mainly used for implementing core concepts.

5. Javascript is mainly used to make website more attractive and interactive.

6. In other words, Javascript is a prototype based object oriented, imperative, loosely typed, interpreted scripting language.

prototype : module | function 

object oriented : Real world deals + OOPS concept

prototype based : here we called it as a prototype based because the creation of object is based on function or in other words, objects are created by functions.

imperative : What ever instructions you are giving, it works on that concepts only, whether you are giving correct instructions or not.

loosely typed : c/c++ = strictly typed
                int a = 100; char ch = 'a'; float f = 4.4f;

                javascript = loosely typed
                a = 100; ch = 'a'; f = 4.5;

                here we use var, let and const keywords to set variable as it have some specific scope.
                var a = "Hello"; let b = 5.6; const pi = 3.14;

7. Javascript is used to make dhtml, here dthml means dynamic html.
8. JavaScript cannot run on its own, browser is responsible for running javascript code.Every browser have javascript engine to execute javascript code.
|-- Google chrome = v8 engine
|-- mozila firefox = spider monkey
|-- Internet explorer = charka

9. ECMA(EUROPEAN COMPUTER MANUFACTURER ASSOCIATION) International created ECMA Script to standerized javascript.Ecma script like ES5, ES6, ES7 etc.

10. JavaScript  cannot deals with HTML Tags directly. Browser creates a DOM Structure where HTML tags are considered as nodes(objects) and with that javascript may interact with html tags.

11. There is a built in object called document. Which wraps the entire HTML Document. Here document is the object of HTMLDocument(Function | Prototype)

document comes under DOM(Document Object Model)

There is another built in object called window. Which deals with entire browser. Here window is the object of Window(Function | Prototype)

window comes under BOM(Browser Object Model)

12. Here we write scripting  inside <script> tag.
<script>
    .......
    .......
</script>
we can also create internal script and external script.
